# OUR FIRST PRINTF
=====================

## the printf function
-----------------------

The printf() function is used in C to print text to the screen. It is a standard C library function and is used to display messages on the console or in the output window of a program.

In addition, printf() also allows you to print variable values.

### we will make a custom function that performs the printf function
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This custom function can use system calls to send characters to standard output.
